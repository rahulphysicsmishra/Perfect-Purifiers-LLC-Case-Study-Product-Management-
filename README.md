### Notes

- **Return Rate**: The percentage of sold products that customers return due to defects, dissatisfaction, or unmet expectations. A low return rate (e.g., below 5%) indicates high product quality and customer satisfaction, minimizing costs associated with reverse logistics and repairs.

- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: A measure of profitability that calculates the percentage return on the initial investment. ROI is calculated as:  
  \[
  \text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Investment Cost}} \times 100
  \]
  A high ROI (e.g., 250%) indicates that the product is expected to generate substantial revenue compared to its costs.

- **IRR (Internal Rate of Return)**: A financial metric used to estimate the profitability of an investment. IRR represents the discount rate at which the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investment’s cash flows equals zero. An IRR above the company’s required rate (e.g., >200%) suggests the investment is highly favorable.

- **VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds)**: Harmful gases emitted by certain solids or liquids, such as paints, cleaners, and building materials. Effective VOC removal in air purifiers is highly valued, as VOCs impact indoor air quality and health.

- **NPV (Net Present Value)**: The value of all future cash flows over the life of the investment, discounted to the present. A positive NPV indicates that the project is expected to generate profit beyond its costs, making it a worthwhile investment.
